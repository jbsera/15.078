    "1) Submit solutions that are your own, in your own words. You are allowed to discuss with other students in general terms, but make sure you are not copying verbatim from another student. Therefore do not read other students' solutions. If you use material from outside this class, reference it in your solution. \n",

    "2) Please download the python file attached in the assignment and complete your answers there in the same file. Read the questions carefully, and make sure you answer every part that the question asks.\n",

    "3) Include relevant code in the PDF submission even if the question doesn't explicitly ask for it. Upload your solutions as a PDF file. Include your name and MIT ID on the first page.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To convert to pdf, you can use the \"print to pdf\" option in jupyter (or equivalent options in other IDE). There are other options to directly download in to pdf format which might include additional installation of packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Show your work and explain your conclusions clearly and precisely. Plots should have clear titles and axis labels so that it is clear what your analysis is showing.\n",
